    - Invented Electromagnet
- Samuel Morse

### INtroduction
**What would happen if all electrons stopped?**

See Page 3/4
### Chapter 1
**How does a telegraph work?**

An electromagnet is on one end, a battery on the other. When the battery is connected, current flows, it activates the magnet (coil) and produces a mechanical click. *Samuel Morse* invented the Morse alphabet to transmit letters

**How did the telegraph change the world?**

It connected cities and countries, making it possible to e.g. synchronize time, financial information and trains

**Discuss Bodanis’ statement that the telegraph was “an early form of globalization”. (p. 26)**

The telegraph made transportation of information instant (before it was very slow). Now not every city was its own world, but everything was synchronized throughout the world

**Discuss the last sentences of the chapter: “The result was a dynamic  immigrant- rich America. It was everything Joseph Henry loved. It was everything Samuel Morse hated.” (p.26) and describe the characters of Joseph Henry and Samuel Morse.**

Samuel Morse was a conspiracy theorist, believing the world was controlled by catholics and jesuits. On the other hand, Henry was more open

### Chapter 2

**In 1875 Alec Bell took an apparatus he had built to the now aged Joseph Henry. Describe the apparatus in your own words or draw it. (p.30)**

It was an electric wire strechting out from a battery and connected to a single tuning fork. By switching the battery on and off, he could make the tuning fork hum in various ways.

**Describe the “artificial throat and lips” that Bell and his brother had created as teenagers. (p.35)**

it was made from a larynx of a sheep and bellows as lungs

**At the time, several researchers were trying to invent a “telephone”. In what way was Bell’s approach different? Describe his telephone experiments on p.36.**

he put a parchment close to his mouth and attached a wire to it. When he spoke, the parchment touched the wire and caused the electric resistance to change

**How does a telephone basically work? (p.36/37)**

See above. The speaker is the exact reverse, moving a surface (plastic) with the unair "waves" in the wire

### Chapter 3

**What were “technological mercenaries”, who employed them and to what purpose? How does the scenario relate to Edison, Orton and Bell? (p. 40)**

Rich financiers tried to find technological mercenaries who could produce the same device using a slightly different process. The original inventor would be destroyed. Orton was the head of Western Union and employed *Thomas Edison* to go against Bell's telephone company

**What “flaw” did Bell’s telephone technology have and how did Edison improve it? (p.41)**

Bell's signal was too weak for longer distances. Edison improved it by sending a base signal through the wire, the voice would modifiy it, making it a little bit weaker or stronger

**Explain why “for decades researchers had dreamed of making a practical artificial light, but no one had come close to succeeding.” (p.42)**

They could see thtat a heated piece of metal would glow, but the challenge was to make the glowing last long enough to be useful as a light source.

**How did Edison attempt to solve the problems? (list several attempts) And how did he eventually succeed? (p. 43-46)**

- using platinum because of the high melting point -> too expensive
- nickel wire -> too bright
- Create vaccuums inside class containers to prevent oxygen from getting to the wire -> still too hot
- Madake bamboo strands from Japan -> successful, over 1500 hours

**Discuss the following quote: “Transferring information faster shrank the globe, just as the lightbulb shrank the night.” (p. 47)**

The telegraph made it possible to exchange information instantly, "shrinking the globe", and the lightbulb "made the night brighter"

**How does the electric motor basically work? (p.48/49) Make a drawing.**

A electromagnet pulls the rotating thing, making it turn about a half revolution. Shortly before it reaches the magnetized point, the magnet switches directions and pulls to the other side. Momentum makes it rotate further and now pulls it for a full revolution. Rinse and repeat...

**What impact did the invention of the electric motor have on urban development and society? (p. 49 / 50 )**

It made elevators possible, important for skyscrapers, and powered streetcars. The spare capacity of the street cars were used to power amusement parks (Roller coasters))

**Discuss the following two quotes: “ [Edison] was supposed to be the greatest electrician of his age, yet he didn’t even know what was happening inside an electric wire.” – “Edison was puzzled by the dots.” (p.52)**

- Edison wasn't an academic and had no deep understanding of electricity.
- He noticed a black spot on the inside of lightbulbs. He never found out why

**What did J.J. Thomson discover? (p.53)**

He found out what the black spots were by "steering" them with a magnet. That's how he discovered the *electron* and that it was electrons that travelled inside a wire. The "bumping and crashing" of these electrons made the wire glow
